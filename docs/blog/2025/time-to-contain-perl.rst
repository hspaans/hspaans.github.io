Time to contain Perl?
=====================

In the world of software development, the choice of programming languages can significantly impact the maintainability and longevity of a project. `Perl <https://www.perl.org/>`_, once a dominant language for web development and system administration, has seen a decline in popularity over the years. As we look towards the future, it's worth considering whether it's time to contain Perl within our projects?

In this context, "containing" Perl refers to stopping the use of Perl for new development and instead isolating existing Perl code within specific modules or services used within an enterprise. This approach allows us to manage the risks associated with legacy technologies while still leveraging their strengths where appropriate. For personal projects, the reasoning is similar, but often more pragmatic as the impact of legacy code is less critical than in an enterprise setting.

The Rise and Fall of Perl
-------------------------

Perl was once hailed as the "duct tape of the internet," thanks to its flexibility and powerful text-processing capabilities. It was widely used for CGI scripting, system administration, and even web application development. However, with the advent of newer languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, Perl's popularity has waned. These newer languages offer more modern syntax, better libraries, and a more active community, making them more appealing to developers.

Especially with the rise of web frameworks like :wikipedia:`Django <Django (web framework)>` (:wikipedia:`Python <Python (programming language)>`), :wikipedia:`Ruby on Rails` (:wikipedia:`Ruby <Ruby (programming language)>`), and :wikipedia:`Node.js` (:wikipedia:`JavaScript`), developers found more efficient ways to build web applications. Maybe also the :wikipedia:`PHP` ecosystem with frameworks like Laravel and Symfony played a role in this shift as it was easier to learn for many web developers and manage then `mod_perl <https://perl.apache.org/>`_ or CGI scripts.

The future of Perl looks uncertain as Perl 6 was `announced in 2000 <https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.meta/2000/10/msg424.html>`_ and later rebranded to Raku and has not seen widespread adoption. In 2020, Perl 7 was announced, aiming to modernize the language and make it more accessible to new developers. In 2021, this plan was slightly adjusted to keep Perl 5 in long-term maintenance mode with only important security and bug fixes coming to it. However, the impact of Perl 7 remains to be seen as it will `only be released when enough features are ready and stable <https://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/2022/05/what-happened-to-perl-7.html>`_.

The Current Landscape
---------------------

As we assess the future of Perl, it's essential to consider the current landscape of software development. Many organizations are adopting microservices architectures, containerization, and :wikipedia:`cloud-native` technologies. These trends emphasize the need for modular, maintainable code that can evolve independently.

In this context, the case for containing Perl code becomes more compelling. By isolating Perl components, we can better manage their lifecycle and reduce the impact of their limitations on the overall system. And the rise of :wikipedia:`DevOps` practices and :wikipedia:`CI/CD` pipelines also emphasizes the need for maintainable and testable code, which can be challenging with legacy Perl codebases.

Here are some key considerations for containing Perl in modern software development:

1. **Modularity**: Break down Perl applications into smaller, manageable components that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This aligns with microservices architectures and promotes better maintainability.
2. **Containerization**: Use containerization technologies like Docker to encapsulate Perl applications and their dependencies. This can simplify deployment and ensure consistency across different environments.
3. **Automated Testing**: Invest in automated testing frameworks and practices to improve the reliability of Perl code. This is crucial for maintaining code quality and facilitating continuous integration.
4. **Documentation**: Improve documentation for Perl codebases to make them more accessible to new developers. This can help mitigate the challenges posed by a shrinking talent pool.
5. **Hiring and Training**: Consider the availability of skilled Perl developers when planning projects. Investing in training for existing team members can help bridge the gap.

While most of these considerations are technology driven, the final one about :wikipedia:`recruitment` and training is more business driven. The availability of skilled Perl developers is decreasing as newer generations of developers are less likely to learn Perl. This can lead to challenges in maintaining and extending Perl codebases, making it essential for organizations to consider the long-term implications of their technology choices.

The Challenges of Perl
----------------------

Despite its strengths, Perl has several challenges that have contributed to its decline:

1. **Readability**: Perl's syntax can be complex and difficult to read, especially for those who are not familiar with it. This can lead to maintenance challenges as codebases grow and evolve.
2. **Community Support**: The Perl community has shrunk over the years, leading to fewer resources, libraries, and frameworks being developed and maintained.
3. **Performance**: While Perl is powerful, it may not always be the most efficient choice for modern applications, especially when compared to languages optimized for specific tasks.
4. **Talent Pool**: As newer generations of developers enter the workforce, many are less familiar with Perl, making it harder to find skilled developers to maintain and extend Perl codebases.
5. **Ecosystem**: The ecosystem around Perl has not kept pace with modern development practices, making it less attractive for new projects.

While commercial support for Perl exists, it is not as widespread as for other languages like Java, Python, or JavaScript. This can make it challenging for organizations to find the necessary support and resources to manage their Perl code effectively. This also affects the availability of training and development resources for teams working with Perl as new developers may to find and hire.

The Case for Containment
------------------------

In light of these challenges, containing Perl code within specific modules or services can offer several benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: As projects grow and evolve, maintaining code written in Perl can become challenging, especially if the original developers are no longer available. Containing Perl code within specific modules or services can help isolate it from the rest of the codebase, making it easier to manage.
2. **Interoperability**: By containing Perl code, we can create clear interfaces between different parts of the system. This allows for easier integration with other languages and technologies, facilitating a more modular architecture.
3. **Legacy Systems**: Many organizations still rely on :wikipedia:`legacy systems` built with Perl. Containing these systems can help ensure they continue to function while allowing for gradual migration to more modern technologies.
4. **Security**: Containing Perl code can also help mitigate security risks associated with outdated libraries and dependencies. By isolating Perl components, we can better manage updates and patches.
5. **Team Dynamics**: As development teams evolve, the skill sets of team members may change. Containing Perl code can help ensure that new team members can work effectively without needing to learn an older language.

While the Perl interpreter is still actively maintained, the libraries and frameworks around it are not as actively developed as those for other languages. This can lead to challenges in finding up-to-date resources and tools for working with Perl. Other languages like Python have even begun to drop built-in modules as they are no longer maintained or considered best practice. This can lead to security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues if not managed properly or running outdated versions.

Challenges of Containment
-------------------------

Managing and containing Perl code is not without its challenges like any legacy technology. Some of the key challenges include:

1. **Technical Debt**: Containing Perl code may not eliminate the :wikipedia:`technical debt` associated with it. Legacy code can still be difficult to work with, and simply isolating it may not address underlying issues.
2. **Integration Complexity**: As we contain Perl code, we must also consider how it will interact with other parts of the system. This can introduce additional complexity and potential points of failure.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Containing Perl code may require dedicated resources for maintenance and support. Organizations must weigh the costs and benefits of this approach.

Maintaining legacy systems is done in many organizations on a minimal budget and often with limited resources. This can make it challenging to allocate the necessary time and effort to properly contain and manage Perl code. A clear strategy and prioritization are essential to ensure that containment efforts are effective and sustainable as part of a broader IT and business strategy. Especially the business side must be on board as well to allocate budget and resources, but also accept potential risks and limitations like no new features or performance improvements in the contained Perl parts as long as the transition is not completed.

The Case for keeping Perl
-------------------------

While the trend is to move away from Perl, there are still valid reasons for keeping Perl code in certain situations:

1. **Familiarity**: Many developers have extensive experience with Perl, and re-training them on a new language can be time-consuming and costly. Keeping Perl code allows organizations to leverage existing expertise.
2. **Proven Solutions**: Perl has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that have been battle-tested over the years. These solutions can be valuable assets for organizations that continue to use Perl.
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Perl's flexibility and expressiveness make it an excellent choice for rapid prototyping and scripting tasks. Keeping Perl code can enable teams to quickly iterate on ideas without the overhead of more rigid languages.
4. **Niche Applications**: In certain domains, such as bioinformatics and text processing, Perl remains a popular choice due to its powerful capabilities. Keeping Perl code in these niche areas can be beneficial.
5. **Legacy Systems**: Many organizations have significant investments in Perl codebases that would be costly and time-consuming to replace. In such cases, it may be more practical to maintain and contain the existing Perl code rather than attempting a complete rewrite.

In some cases, the cost and effort required to migrate away from Perl may outweigh the benefits. Organizations must carefully evaluate their specific circumstances and make informed decisions about whether to keep or contain Perl code. If the Perl code is stable, well-maintained, and continues to meet the needs of the organization, there may be little incentive to replace it if the risks and costs are too high. We see the same with :wikipedia:`COBOL` in many financial institutions and mainframe systems that are still in use today where the costs to run today are lower than a complete rewrite or migration.

Conclusion about containing Perl
--------------------------------

In conclusion, containing Perl code within our projects presents both opportunities and challenges. While it can improve maintainability, interoperability, and security, we must also address the technical debt and integration complexities that come with it. By carefully considering these factors, we can make informed decisions about the role of Perl in our software development efforts.

Ultimately, the decision to contain Perl should be based on the specific needs and context of each project. As we move forward in the ever-evolving landscape of software development, it's crucial to remain adaptable and open to change, ensuring that our technology choices align with our long-term goals. But from an enterprise architecture perspective, it is indeed time to contain Perl as part of a broader strategy to manage legacy technologies and embrace modern development practices.

The key is to have a clear strategy, allocate the necessary resources, and involve all stakeholders in the decision-making process. By doing so, we can ensure that our software development efforts remain robust, flexible, and aligned with our long-term objectives. This isn't just about Perl; it's about how we maintain and evolve our entire technology stack in a rapidly changing world. We must be proactive in addressing the challenges of legacy technologies while embracing the opportunities presented by modern development practices.

As closing note, it's important to remember that technology choices within organizations should always be driven by business needs and goals. While technical considerations are crucial, they must be balanced with the broader context of the organization's strategy and objectives. By taking a holistic approach to technology management, we can ensure that our software development efforts contribute to the overall success and sustainability of the organization.
